## 💡 Smart Features

### Package Range Detection:
The system automatically classifies investments into ranges based on amount:
```php
if($amount >= 100 && $amount <= 999) {
    $packageRange = 'Basic Range (0.5% Daily)';
    $packageColor = '#059669';
} elseif($amount >= 1000 && $amount <= 4999) {
    $packageRange = 'Premium Range (0.7% Daily)';
    $packageColor = '#dc2626';
} else {
    $packageRange = 'VIP Range (1.0% Daily)';
    $packageColor = '#7c3aed';
}
```

### Empty State Handling:
When no activations exist, shows:
- 📊 Icon with friendly message
- "No Activation History" heading
- Helpful description
- 🚀 "Start Investing" button linking to activation page

### Responsive Design:

## 🚀 Database Upgrade
